## Usage
1. Mulicore processor
2. Cloud infrastructure
3. Big networked computation clusters

## Advanteges
1. doing multiple task at once (Multi-Thread)
2. concurrency (dealing with lots of things at once)
3. cheap & eazy
4. simple syntax, eazy to learn, read and write code
5. fast build time, start up and run
6. requires fewer resoures (less CPU and Memory)
7. compiled language: compliles into single binary (machine code:  .exe)
- **simple & readble** syntax of dynamically typed language like Python.
- **efficiency & safety** of a lower-level, statically typed language like C++
- server-side or backend language (Microservices , wen applications m DataBase services) -- (docker, HashCorp Vault, Cockroach DB)


---------------------
### here are a few exercises for you to try using the concepts you've learned so far in Golang:

1. **Array Reversal:** Write a program in Golang that declares an array of 10 integers. Initialize this array with some values of your choice, then write a function to reverse the array and print the reversed array.

2. **Find the Maximum Value:** Write a Golang program where the user is asked to enter a series of numbers. The numbers will be stored in a slice. Write a function to find and print the maximum number among these.

3. **Prime Numbers:** Write a Golang program that prints all the prime numbers from 1 to 100. Use loops to check if a number is prime or not.

4. **Sorting Algorithm:** Implement a simple sorting algorithm (like Bubble Sort) in Golang. You should declare an array of integers and sort them using your algorithm. Print out the array before and after sorting it.

5. **Fibonacci Sequence:** Write a program in Golang that prints the first 20 numbers in the Fibonacci sequence.

6. **String Reversal:** Write a function in Golang to reverse a string. Use the concept of slices in this program. 

Remember that these exercises are meant to help you practice your basic skills in Golang, so take your time and make sure you understand what you're doing in each one. If you're unsure about anything, don't hesitate to ask for help or look up more information online. Happy coding!
